Name
	sctp set connectdelay

SYNOPSIS
	sctp set connectdelay <connectdelay> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	If the SCTP Socket is client-side, connectDelay specifies
	the delay time in milliseconds after which a connection
	with the server will be attempted. This delay is necessary
	when there is network disruption and the connection between
	the client and the server breaks, so that the SCTP stack
	doesn't continuously attempt to reconnect.
	Defalut is 30000 milliseconds.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<connectdelay>	-	Connect delay in milliseconds.

	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.

EXAMPLES
	sctp set connectdelay 40000

DESCRIPTION
	For outgoing messages congestion control stack needs to have 3 thresholds
	- delays of outgoing messages before it will be sent to IP channel (3

SYNOPSIS
	sctp server create <sever-name> <host-ip> <host-port> <socket-type> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new SCTP Server (or TCP Server) instance.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<server-name>	-	Name of the new Server created. This must be
					unique and takes any String value.

	<host-ip>		-	The host IP address to which the SCTP Server
					socket will bind to.

					For SCTP multi-home support, you can pass multiple
					IP addresses as comma separated values. The Server
					socket will bind to the primary IP address and
					when it becomes unavailable, it will automatically
					fall back to secondary address. If the socket-type
					is TCP, these comma separated values will be
					ignored and the Server socket will always bind to
					the primary IP address (the first value in the
					comma separated list).

	<host-port>		-	The host port to which the underlying SCTP Server
					socket will bind to.

	Optional Parameters

	<socket-type>	-	If you do not specify the socket-type as "TCP",
					by default it will be SCTP.

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
						If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
						will be used.

EXAMPLES
	sctp server create TestServer 127.0.0.1 2905

	The above command will create a new SCTP Server identified as TestServer and bind
	the Server socket to the IP address 127.0.0.1 and port 2905.

	sctp server create TestServerMulti 10.2.50.145,10.2.50.146 2905

	The above command will create a new SCTP Server identified as TestServerMulti and
	bind the Server socket to the IP address 10.2.50.145 and port 2905. If 10.2.50.145
	is unavailable, the Server will automatically fall back to 10.2.50.146.

	sctp server create TestServerTCP 127.0.0.1 2906 TCP

	The above command will create a new TCP Server identified as TestServerTCP and
	bind the socket to the IP address 127.0.0.1 and port 2906.

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new SCTP (Client side or Server side)
	association.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<assoc-name>		-	Name of the new Association created. This must be
					unique and takes any String value.

	<CLIENT | SERVER>	-	Specify if this association is client side or
					server side. If it is client side, it will
					initiate the connection to peer. If it is server
					side, it will wait for peer to initiate the
					connection. The connection request will be
					accepted from peer-ip: peer:port.

	<peer-ip>		-	In a client side association, the server IP
					address to which the client is connecting to.

					In a server side association, the client IP
					address from which connections will be accepted.

	<peer-port>		-	In a client side association, the server Port
					to which the client is connecting to.

					In a server side association, the client port from
					which connections will be accepted.

	<host-ip>		-	In a client side association, the local IP address
					to which the socket will bind to.

					For SCTP multi-home support, you can pass multiple
					IP addresses as comma separated values. The
					Association will bind to the primary IP address
					and when it becomes unavailable, it will
					automatically fall back to secondary address.
					If the socket-type is TCP, these comma separated
					values will be ignored and the Assocation will
					always bind to the primary IP address (the first
					value in the comma separated list). This is
					required only for a client side Association.

					For a server side association, even if you specify
					these values it will be ignored.

	<host-port>		-	In a client side association, the local port to
					which the socket will bind to. This is
					required only for a client side Association.

					For a server side association, even if you specify
					these values it will be ignored.

	<server-name>	-	In a server-side association, the server-name must
					be passed to associate with the Server identified
					by that name. You must ensure that the Server
					identified by server-name has already been created
					using the sctp server create command.

					In a client-side association, this is not required
					and you should not pass this parameter.

	Optional Parameters

	<socket-type>	-	If you do not specify the socket-type as "TCP",
					by default it will be SCTP. If it is a
					SERVER SCTP Association, the socket-type must
					match with the one specified while creating the
					Server.

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.

EXAMPLES
	sctp association create Assoc1 CLIENT
	192.168.56.101 2905 192.168.56.1,192.168.56.1 2905

	The above command will create a new CLIENT SCTP Association identified as Assoc1.
	The client side will initiate the connection. It will bind the
	host-ip 192.168.56.1 and host-port 2905 to the Server IP 192.168.56.101 and
	port 2905.

	sctp association create Assoc2 SERVER TestServer 192.168.56.1 2905

	The above command will create a new SERVER SCTP association with the Server
	identified as TestServer and accept connections from peer whose IP address is
	192.168.56.1 and port 2905.

	SYNOPSIS
		sctp association modify <assoc-name> <stack-name> <CLIENT | SERVER> servername <server-name>
		peerhost <peer-ip> peerport <peer-port> host <host-ip> port <host-port> sockettype <socket-type>
		extraaddresses <extra-host-addresses>

	DESCRIPTION
		This command is used to modify a existed SCTP (Client side or Server side)
		association.

	PARAMETERS

		Standard Parameters

		<assoc-name>	-	Name of the existed Association which will be modified.

		<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.


		<CLIENT | SERVER>	-	Specify if this association is client side or
						server side.

		Optional Parameters

		<peer-ip>		-	In a client side association, the server IP
						address to which the client is connecting to.

						In a server side association, the client IP
						address from which connections will be accepted.

		<peer-port>		-	In a client side association, the server Port
						to which the client is connecting to.

						In a server side association, the client port from
						which connections will be accepted.

		<host-ip>		-	In a client side association, the local IP address
						to which the socket will bind to.

		<host-port>		-	In a client side association, the local port to
						which the socket will bind to. This is
						required only for a client side Association.

						For a server side association, even if you specify
						these values it will be ignored.

		<server-name>	-	In a server-side association, the server-name.

						In a client-side association, this is not required
						and you should not pass this parameter.

		<socket-type>	-	socket-type "TCP"/"SCTP". If it is a
						SERVER SCTP Association, the socket-type must
						match with the one specified while creating the
						Server.

		<extra-host-addresses> - For SCTP multi-home support, you can pass multiple
						IP addresses as comma separated values. The
						Association will bind to the primary IP address
						and when it becomes unavailable, it will
						automatically fall back to secondary address.
						If the socket-type is TCP, these comma separated
						values will be ignored and the Assocation will
						always bind to the primary IP address (host). This is
						required only for a client side Association.

						For a server side association, even if you specify
						these values it will be ignored.



	EXAMPLES
		sctp association modify Assoc1 sctpManagement1 CLIENT port 2476

		The above command will modify a CLIENT SCTP Association identified as Assoc1
		which belongs to SCTP management with name sctpManagement1.

		If an Association is connected stack will drop the connection firstly.
		Then the Association will reconnect itself.
