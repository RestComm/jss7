Name
	sctp server create

SYNOPSIS
	sctp server create <sever-name> <host-ip> <host-port> <socket-type>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new SCTP Server (or TCP Server) instance. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<server-name>		-	Name of the new Server created. This must be 
					unique and takes any String value.

	<host-ip>		-	The host IP address to which the SCTP Server 
					socket will bind to. 

					For SCTP multi-home support, you can pass multiple 
					IP addresses as comma separated values. The Server
					socket will bind to the primary IP address and 
					when it becomes unavailable, it will automatically
					fall back to secondary address. If the socket-type
					is TCP, these comma separated values will be 
					ignored and the Server socket will always bind to
					the primary IP address (the first value in the 
					comma separated list).

	<host-port>		-	The host port to which the underlying SCTP Server
					socket will bind to.

	Optional Parameters
	
	<socket-type>		-	If you do not specify the socket-type as "TCP",
					by default it will be SCTP.

EXAMPLES
	sctp server create TestServer 127.0.0.1 2905

	The above command will create a new SCTP Server identified as TestServer and bind 
	the Server socket to the IP address 127.0.0.1 and port 2905.

	sctp server create TestServerMulti 10.2.50.145,10.2.50.146 2905

	The above command will create a new SCTP Server identified as TestServerMulti and 
	bind the Server socket to the IP address 10.2.50.145 and port 2905. If 10.2.50.145
	is unavailable, the Server will automatically fall back to 10.2.50.146.

	sctp server create TestServerTCP 127.0.0.1 2906 TCP
	
	The above command will create a new TCP Server identified as TestServerTCP and 
	bind the socket to the IP address 127.0.0.1 and port 2906.
