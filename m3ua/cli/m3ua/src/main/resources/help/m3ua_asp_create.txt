Name
	m3ua asp create

SYNOPSIS
	m3ua asp create <asp-name> <sctp-association> aspid <aspid> heartbeat <true|false>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new Application Server Process. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<asp-name>			-	Name of the new Application Server Process 
						created. This must be unique and takes any
						String value.

	<sctp-association>		-	Name of the SCTP Association
	
	Optional Parameters

	<aspid>				-	Identifier for this newly created
						Application Server Process. If this is 
						not passed, next available aspid will be
						used.

	heartbeat <true|false>		-	If this parameter is enabled (value set to
						true), then heartbeat mechanism is enabled
						between M3UA peers. When this is enabled,
						it sends a Heartbeat message every 10
						seconds. If there is no response for the 
						third heartbeat then it assumes that the 
						underlying network is dead. So it closes 
						the connection and attempts to connect 
						again. The M3UA peers are brought back to 
						the same state as they were prior to 
						dying.

						This is an optional parameter and if 
						unspecified, heartbeat mechanism is 
						disabled.  	

EXAMPLES
	m3ua asp create ASP1 Assoc1 aspid 12 heartbeat true
	
	The above command will create a new M3UA Application Server Process with name ASP1
	and id 12. Heartbeat mechanism is enabled.
