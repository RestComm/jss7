Name
	sccp address create

SYNOPSIS
	sccp address create <id> <address-indicator> <point-code> <subsystem-number> 
	<translation-type> <numbering-plan> <nature-of-address-indicator> <digits>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new primary address or backup address of 
	translation. You can create a new newCallingParty address as well
	using this command. The global title address information of this command is combined with
	the global title being translated by examining the mask provided in the 
	'sccp rule create' command. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters
                                              
	<id>			-	A unique number to identify this address.

	<address-indicator>	-	The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP 
					Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
					length. Its function is to indicate which
					information elements are present so that the 
					address can be interpreted. In other words, it 
					indicates the type of addressing information that 
					is to be found in the address field. The 
					addressing information from the original global 
					title is then compared with the passed address
					information to match the rule. 

					SCCP ADDRESS INDICATOR
					--------------------------------
					| 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 |3 | 2 | 1 |
					--------------------------------

					Bit '1'     : PC Indicator              
						      (1 = included)

					Bit '2'     : SSN Indicator             
						      (1 = included)

					Bit '3 - 6' : GT Indicator		
						      (0000 = GT not included)
						      (0001 = GT includes 
							      Nature of Address)
						      (0010 = GT includes
							      Translation Type)
						      (0011 = GT includes 
							      Translation Type, 
							      Numbering Plan and 
							      Encoding Scheme)
						      (0100 = GT includes 
							      Translation Type, 
							      Numbering Plan and 
							      Encoding Scheme and
							      Nature of Address)

					Bit '7'     : Routing Indicator 	
						      (0 = Route on GT, 
						      1 = Route on PC + SSN)	

					Bit '8'     : Reserved for National use.

	<point-code>		-	MTP Signaling Point Code. This is ignored if 
					Bit '0' of address-indicator is not set.

	<subsystem-number>	-	This is ignored if Bit '1' of address-indicator is 
					not set.

	<translation-type>	-	This is ignored if GT Indicator is 0000 or 0001.

					TRANSLATION TYPE VALUES
	
					Value		Description
					----------------------------------	
					0		Unknown

					1  - 63		International Service

					64 - 127	Spare

					128 - 254	National Network Specific

					255		Reserved for Expansion

	<numbering-plan>	-	The Number Plan (NP) field specifies the numbering
					plan which the address information follows. This
					is ignored if GT Indicator is 0000, 0001 or 0010.

	<nature-of-address>	-	The Nature of Address Indicator (NAI) field 
					defines the address range for a specific numbering 
					plan. This is only used if GT Indicator is 0100.

	<digits>		-	The global title address information to translate 
					to. Specified as string of digits divided into 
					subsections using separator '/' depending on if 
					the mask contains separator or not. 
					The digits string can contain:  

					DIGIT PATTERN
					
					Value		Description
					----------------------------------	
					-		padding - ignored

					/		separator used to split the digit 
							pattern into sections. 
							Each section is processed 
							differently as specified by the 
							mask parameter in the 
							'sccp rule create' command.
