Name
	sccp dest create

SYNOPSIS
	sccp dest create <sap-id> <id> <first-dpc> <last-dpc> <first-sls> <last-sls> 
	<sls-mask>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to define a new Destination for a Service Access Point. 
	For every SAP in the system, you should configure one or more Destinations. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters
                                              
	<sap-id>	-	The identifier of the SAP for which this new Destination 
				is being defined. You must ensure that the SAP has been 
				created prior to issuing this command.

	<id>		-	An identifier for this newly created Destination. 
				The number must be unique within each SAP.

	<first-dpc>	-	The first value of the remote signaling point codes range.

	<last-dpc>	-	The last value of the remote signaling point codes range. 
				If the Destination specifies only a single Signaling 
				Point Code, this value must be equal to the value 
				specified for 'first-dpc'.

	<first-sls>	-	The first value of the SLS range. 
				SLS value range is from 0 to 255.

	<last-sls>	-	The last value of the SLS range. 

	<sls-mask>	-	The mask value. SLS of a message will be exposed by 
				performing a bitwise AND operation with this mask prior to
				comparing it with first-sls and last-sls values.


EXAMPLES
	sccp dest create 1 1 201 201 0 7 7
	
	The above command will create a new Destination (identified by number '1') for 
	a Service Access Point identified by the number '1'. The values for 'first-dpc', 
	'last-dpc', 'first-sls', 'last-sls' and 'sls-mask' are 201, 201, 0, 7 and 7 
	respectively.

	sccp dest create 2 1 300 399 0 255 255

	The above command will create a new Destination (identified by number '2') for 
	a Service Access Point identified by the number '1'. The values for 'first-dpc', 
	'last-dpc', 'first-sls', 'last-sls' and 'sls-mask' are 300, 399, 0, 255 and 255 
	respectively. This Destination will cover all possible SLS values. 
	Therefore the value for first-sls =0, last-sls=255 and sls-mask=255
