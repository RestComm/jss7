DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new SCCP Routing Rule. You must ensure that 
	primary and backup addresses are configured properly prior to executing this
	command.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters
                                              
	<id>			-	A unique number to identify this Rule.

	<mask>			-	A mask defines which part of the originally dialed 
					digits remains in the translated digits and which
					part is replaced by the digits from primary or 
					backup address. A mask is divided into sections by 
					separator '/'. The number of sections in a mask
					should be equal to the sections in digits passed 
					in this command and the sections in primary or 
					backup address.

					MASK DEFINITIONS

					Mnemonic	Function
					----------------------------------	
					- 		Ignore

					/		Separator used to split the mask 
							into sections.

					K		Retain the original dialed digits 
							of this section in the translated 
							digits.

					R		Replace the original dialed digits 
							of this section with the same 
							section from primary or backup 
							address in the translated digits.

	<address-indicator>	-	The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP 
					Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
					length. Its function is to indicate which
					information elements are present so that the 
					address can be interpreted. In other words, it 
					indicates the type of addressing information that 
					is to be found in the address field. The 
					addressing information from the original global 
					title is then compared with the passed address
					information to match the rule. 

					SCCP ADDRESS INDICATOR

					digits should match with theses digits as per the 
					rule specified below: 

					DIGIT PATTERN
					
					Value		Description

					-		padding - ignored

					*		wildcard - matches any number of 
							digits

					?		wildcard - matches exactly one

	<ruleType>		-	Takes one of the following values defined below.

					RULE TYPE VALUES
					
					Value		Description
					----------------------------------	
					solitary	Only one (primary) address is used 
							for routing.
							(<backup-address-id> may be missed
							in this case).

					dominant	Both primary and backup 
							addresses are used and mandatory. 
							If both the addresses are 
							available, the primary address is 
							used for routing.

					loadshared	Both primary and backup 
							addresses are used and mandatory. 
							If both the addresses are 
							available, either primary or 
							backup address is used for 
							routing. 
							The <loadsharing-algorithm> should
							be configured in this case.
			
					broadcast	Both primary and backup addresses
							are used and are mandatory. All
							messages are routed to both
							addresses.

	<primary-address-id>	-	Identifies the SCCP Address used as the primary 
					translation.

	Optional Parameters

	<backup-address-id>	-	Identifies the SCCP Address used as the backup
					translation in case the pointcode specified by the
					primary address is not available. Backup address
					is used if <ruleType> is not "solitary".

					"loadshared". The Loadsharing algorithm is 
					configured here. Possible values of the parameter
					are:

							traffic is local (mobicents stack)
							originated

					bit3		if( (SLS & 0x08) == 0 ) 
							<route to primary> else 
							<route to backup>
							This algorithm can be used if not 
							all traffic is local 
							(mobicents stack) originated. 
							But only 8 links are acceptable in
							both linksets.

					bit2		if( (SLS & 0x04) == 0 ) 
							<route to primary> else 
							<route to backup>
							This algorithm can be used if not 
							all traffic is local 
							(mobicents stack) originated. 
							But only 8 links are acceptable in
							both linksets.

					bit1		if( (SLS & 0x02) == 0 ) 
							<route to primary> else 
							<route to backup>
							This algorithm can be used if not 
							all traffic is local 
							(mobicents stack) originated. 
							But only 8 links are acceptable in
							both linksets.

					bit0		if( (SLS & 0x01) == 0 ) 
							<route to primary> else 
							<route to backup>
							This algorithm can be used if not 
							all traffic is local 
							(mobicents stack) originated. 
							But only 8 links are acceptable in
							both linksets.


	<new-callingPartyAddress-id>
				-	This address will replace the 
					callingPartyAddresses of messages that fit a Rule.

	<originationType>	-	Takes one of the following values defined below.
					If the parameter is not defined, rule applies to
					all messages regardless of their origination.

					ORIGINATION TYPE VALUES
					
					Value			Description
					-------------------------------------	
					localOriginated		If this parameter is 
								"localOriginated", then a 
								rule applies only for 
								messages originating from 
								local SCCP users 
								(for example a local 
								TCAP stack).

					remoteOriginated	If this parameter is 
								"remoteOriginated", then a 
								rule applies only for 
								messages originating from 
								SS7 network and not for
								messages originating from
								local SCCP users. 
								
	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.	
					
	<networkId>		-  A digital parameter that specifies to which virtual SS7
					network this rule belongs. If this parameter
					is skipped - networkId will be set to "0" by default.

	<calling-address-indicator>
					- Address indicator for calling address matching.
					See above address-indicator

	<calling-point-code>
					- Pointcode of calling sccp address. MTP Signaling Point Code.
					This is ignored if Bit '0' of address-indicator is not set.

	<calling-subsystem-number>
					- This is ignored if Bit '1' of address-indicator is
					not set.

	<calling-translation-type>
					- This is ignored if GT Indicator is 0000 or 0001.
					See <translation-type> above for more details.

	<calling-numbering-plan>
					- A digital parameter that specifies to which virtual SS7
					network this rule belongs. If this parameter
					is skipped - networkId will be set to "0" by default.

	<calling-nature-of-address-indicator>
					- The Nature of Address Indicator (NAI) field
					defines the address range for a specific numbering
					plan. This is only used if GT Indicator is 0100.

	<calling-digits-pattern>
					- Specifies the string of digits for pattern matching.
					There is no mask for calling digits, hence the division separator is ignored.
					See above <digits> for more information on pattern matching.
