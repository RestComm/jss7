Name
	sccp dest modify

SYNOPSIS
	sccp dest modify <sap-id> <id> <first-dpc> <last-dpc> <first-sls> <last-sls> 
	<sls-mask>


DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify the values of a Destination previously defined for
	a Service Access Point.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters
                                              
	<sap-id>	-	The identifier of the SAP whose Destination is being 
				modified. 

	<id>		-	The identifier of the Destination that is being modified.

	<first-dpc>	-	The first value of the remote signaling point codes range.

	<last-dpc>	-	The last value of the remote signaling point codes range. 
				If the Destination specifies only a single Signaling 
				Point Code, this value must be equal to the value 
				specified for 'first-dpc'.

	<first-sls>	-	The first value of the SLS range. 
				SLS value range is from 0 to 255.

	<last-sls>	-	The last value of the SLS range. 

	<sls-mask>	-	The mask value. SLS of a message will be exposed by 
				performing a bitwise AND operation with this mask prior to
				comparing it with first-sls and last-sls values.

EXAMPLES
	sccp dest modify 1 1 201 299 0 255 255 

	The above command will modify the values of the Destination identified by the
	number '1' within the Service Access Point identified by the number '1'. 
	The new values for 'first-dpc', 'last-dpc', 'first-sls', 'last-sls' and 'sls-mask'
	are 201, 299, 0, 255 and 255 respectively.
